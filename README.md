## 4. üßπ Data Cleaning/Preparation
### Key preparation steps included:
- Data Standardization:
  - Converted date fields (e.g., `HireDate`) to a readable format (e.g., month names, quarters) where needed.
  - Corrected formatting for non-date fields like `Salary` to ensure numerical consistency (e.g., removed any text or symbols).
  - Ensured consistent naming conventions (e.g., `Female` vs. `F` not present).
  - Categorized employees into age groups and tenure ranges for analysis.
- Creating Derived Columns:
  - Created `FullName` by concatenating `FirstName` and `LastName` using the Excel formula:
       ```excel
       =[@FirstName]&" "&[@LastName]
       ```
  - Created `Age Group`, `Distance Group`, and `Employee Classification` using nested IF Excel functions:
     ```excel
     =IF([@Age]<30,"<30",IF([@Age]<=40,"30-40",">40"))
     ```
     ```excel
     =IF([@[DistanceFromHome (KM)]]<=5,"Close",IF([@[DistanceFromHome (KM)]]<=15,"FAR","Very Far"))
     ```
     ```excel
     =IF([@YearsAtCompany]<=2,"Junior Employee",IF([@YearsAtCompany]<=5,"Mid-Tenure Employee",IF([@YearsAtCompany]<=7,"Senior Employee","Long-Serving Employee")))
     ```
  - Created `Role Status` (indicating 'Different Role' or 'Same Role') using the IF function:
   ```excel
     =IF([@YearsAtCompany]=[@YearsInMostRecentRole],"Same Role","Different Role")
   ```
- Handling missing values and duplicates:
  - Confirmed no duplicate EmployeeIDs in the raw data.
- Data Aggregation:
  - Generated pivot table summaries for key metrics (e.g., gender counts, average salaries) using standardized data.
  - Grouped data by categories such as department, job role, and education level for detailed analysis.
  - Created plots and charts based on pivot table summaries to visualize trends and patterns.
